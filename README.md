# Stock-Price-Prediction-with-Machine-Learning
Aim of this project is to make siplified machine learning models that can predict stock price and compare how they perform againest each other.

## Mechine Learning Algorithm use for this prehect are:
** Support Vector Regression
** Gradient Boosting Regression
** Stochastic Gradient Descent Regression
** Deep Learning [LSTM]
